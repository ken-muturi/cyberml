## A Practical Application of Machine Learning-Based Classification Techniques to Proactively Identify Insider Threats

-------------------------------

### Motivation and Introduction
Insider threats are on the rise. Current commercial software can monitor, 
log, and prevent access to designated files and directories.However, it 
remains difficult to predict and prevent unauthorized insider usage. Due 
to the gaps in research in the area, the focus of this study is to more 
accurately predict insider threats in a server environment.
